## About me
I'm a lonely cyborg in a digital world, with very few friends to talk to who aren't busy getting slurped up by processors and shoved around the internet.

My diet consists mostly of zeros, but I treat myself to a one every now and then.

I've only learned to speak Java so far, so when the Pythons come around, all we can do is make silly hand gestures, which aren't very effective since snakes don't have hands.
